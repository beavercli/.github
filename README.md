# BeaverCLI (coming soon)

BeaverCLI will be a command line tool that lets you browse and search documentation across your GitHub repositories. The goal is to merge distributed knowledge from many repos into one indexed, searchable source of truth so you can find answers without hopping between projects.

## Status
- Early-stage and in active development.
- Core API work lives at https://github.com/beavercli/beaver_api.

## What to expect
- Unified indexing across multiple GitHub repos.
- Fast, remote search tailored for docs and knowledge sharing.
- Simple CLI workflows that fit into your existing tooling.
